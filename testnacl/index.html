<!--
For the SDK examples, we support several toolchains (e.g. PNaCl, newlib,
GLibC). In your own code, you'll likely just choose one toolchain (probably
PNaCl), and load that directly.

Rather than have each example repeat the same module loading code for each
toolchain it supports, we set custom data attributes on the body. Those
attributes are read by common.js to determine which toolchains are supported
for the example.
